the set collection is base on map
but the set is single direction while the map is double directions


TreeSet and TreeMap has come true in the same in the foundation ,
they has the almost same methods,
They both base on two-tree ,need Comparator,judge the place only by method :compareTo(Object o);
need to override the method 

HashSet and HashMap also has come true in the same in the foundation,
also need a comparator 
its hashCode accorder to its methods : hashCode() and equals(Object o)
must override two methods : hashCode() and equals(Object o)

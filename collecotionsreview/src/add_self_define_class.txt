when we want to delete a object in a collection ,we should override two method
                              hashCode();
                              equals();

In interface : List   (has its own order,base on array[],allow equals objects)

                  its contains()   remove()   removeAll() and so on methods is depend on 
                  equals() method to judge two or more elements is equals
                  
                  so when we add class our own define:
                  must override equals() method 
                  
In interface : Set    (has no order,accorder to hash Code,forbid equals objects)

                its almost methods is base on
                hashCode() and equals();
                first accord to objects' hashCode() to seek it's position 
                then judge the position whether has a object then judge the two 
                object is equals,if equals then use another hash calculate connect with 
                the position to seek another position or search on the next position
                
                so when we add class our own define:
                must override   equals() and hashCode();
